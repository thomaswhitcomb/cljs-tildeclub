	  <h3>Overview</h3>
	  <p>The Game Of Life is played on a 2 dimension grid. The <code>x</code> axis is horizontal and the <code>y</code> axis is vertical.  Each node on the grid can either be live or dead.  The live nodes are green and the dead nodes are not green.</p>
	  <p>The Universe for the GOL is the set of live nodes.  Each node is described with a catesian X,Y pair and a <code>:l</code> or <code>:d</code> value.  The <code>:l</code> means live and you can guess what <code>:d</code> stands for.  Each cartesion pair is inclosed in a  square brackets and is followed by a <code>:l</code> or <code>:d</code>. </p>
	  <p>For example, "<code>[3 7] :l</code>" is a node at coordinate 3,7 and it is live.</p>
	  <p>A set of nodes is inclosed in a pair of curly brackets. So "<code>{ [5 6] :l, [8 17] :l}</code>" is a universe of two nodes.</p>
	  <p>The game starts out with a universe called "diehard".  This universe dies out after 130 runs (evolutions).  Every time you push the "Run Game of Life" button, the universe evolves once.  The rules for evolution are:
	  <ul>
		  <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours survives.</li>
		  <li>Any dead cell with three live neighbours becomes a live cell.</li>
		  <li> All other live cells die in the next generation. Similarly, all other dead cells stay dead.</li>
	  </ul>

	  <p>The initial universe constitutes the seed of the game. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every node in the universe; births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called an tick. Each generation is a pure function of the preceding one. The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

	  <h3>Predefined Universes</h3>
	  <p>There are many pre-defined universes.  Here is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life#Examples_of_patterns">common set</a>.  There are a few.  You can cut and paste them on the game page in the Universe State text field.
